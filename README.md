# Email Evictor
Spam emails refer to unwanted emails sent in bulk to users, when they cannot be detected they tend to flood users inboxes and possibly bury important emails; a spam detection system can be very helpful for something like this. 
Email Evictor is a possible solution to this issue. Email Evictor will be a program that uses AI for the purpose of identifying and discarding spam emails. 

## Algorithms
In order to complete our Email Evictor program we will use bayes classification to determine whether or not an email is considered spam. 
Using specific features, such as the domain name, username, use of unnecessary capitalization and numbers to determine the probability that an email is spam. 
We will research the usage of these features in spam email and the probability they occur and use bayes classification to determine the probability if the email is spam or not. 

## Open Source Codes
### TensorFlow
Is a free open source library that is often used for AI development. TensorFlow will be the driving force behind the program.
https://www.tensorflow.org/
### NiceGUI
NiceGUI is a free framework for python for developing UI across most major browsers.
https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming

Other open source tools are in consideration but not officially confirmed for the program. Some of these include Anvil, JustPy, SciPy, MatplotLib.
